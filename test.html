        <h2>Influencer Engagement & Sponsorship Coordination Platform - V2 (Advanced Version)</h2>
        <h3>Completed: December 2024</h3>

        <div class="section">
            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                The project focuses on the development of an advanced web application platform designed to bridge the gap between sponsors and influencers. This advanced version builds upon the previous platform (V1) by adding features such as asynchronous task processing, enhanced performance using Redis caching, and improved security with token-based authentication. The system allows sponsors to create and manage campaigns, while influencers can accept ad requests and manage their profiles. The platform aims to streamline the advertising process, optimize influencer engagement, and provide better control over campaign outcomes.

        <!-- Description -->
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Project Description</h4>
            <p>
                The "Influencer Engagement & Sponsorship Coordination Platform - V2" is an advanced version of its predecessor (V1), with several enhancements aimed at improving system performance and user experience. This version incorporates asynchronous task handling with Celery and Redis, allows real-time updates using Vue.js, and enhances security with JWT authentication. The platform facilitates campaign creation, management, and tracking, as well as influencer engagement, and aims to provide seamless interactions for both sponsors and influencers.
